data(stomata)
}
%- maybe also `usage' for other objects documented here.
\format{
A data frame with 3 columns and 24 rows. The columns are:
\itemize{
 \item{area}{mean stomatal area.}
\item{C02}{label for which C02 treatment the measurement relates to.}
\item{tree}{label for individual tree.}
}}

\details{The context for these simulated data is given in section 6.1 of 
the source book.
